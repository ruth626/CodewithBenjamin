    <h2> This is my biography </h2>
    <p>Several parts of this “second brain” play a large role in the Brain 
        Rules. The claw of the scorpion, called the amygdale, allows you 
        to feel rage. Or fear. Or pleasure. Or memories of past experiences 
        of rage, fear, or pleasure. The amygdala is responsible for both 
        the creation of emotions and the memories they generate. notice that the neural forest, large and seemingly distant, is 
        surprisingly complicated. Take the two neurons between which we 
        are floating. We are between just two connection points. </p>
